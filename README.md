Evolutionary-Computing-Generalist-Agent-against-Evoman-framework
 
The objective of this assignment is to gain experience with using Evolutionary Computation. To this end you will develop, apply, and compare Evolutionary Algorithms for the task of video game playing using a python framework called EvoMan.

The Evoman framework can be found in this link: https://github.com/karinemiras/evoman_framework

The genetic algorithm used as the second algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/Konstantinos-Sakellariou/GeneticAlgorithmPython
